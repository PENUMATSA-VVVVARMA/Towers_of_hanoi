## ðŸŽ¯ **Double Modal Issue - SOLUTION APPLIED**

I've fixed the main causes of the double modal appearance:

### âœ… **Fixes Applied:**

1. **Prevent Double Submissions:**
   - Added `isClosing` state to prevent multiple actions
   - Check for existing submission/success states before allowing new submissions

2. **Improved Success Timing:**
   - Reduced success display time from 2000ms to 1500ms
   - Set `isClosing` state immediately when success occurs

3. **Better State Management:**
   - Reset `gameResult` state after submission/closing
   - Added safeguards in `handleGameComplete` to prevent showing modal twice
   - Enhanced state cleanup in App.js

### ðŸ”§ **How It Works Now:**

**Successful Submission:**
- âœ… Show success message for 1.5 seconds
- âœ… Automatically close and go to leaderboard
- âœ… Clear all states to prevent re-showing

**Skip Button:**
- âœ… Immediately close modal 
- âœ… Return to main menu
- âœ… Prevent double-clicks during submission

### ðŸš€ **Test Instructions:**

1. **Complete a game**
2. **Submit score** - should show success briefly then go to leaderboard
3. **Complete another game** 
4. **Click skip** - should immediately return to menu
5. **No double modals should appear**

The main fixes are in place! The modal should now appear only once and close properly. If you still see the issue, it might be because:

- Old cached JavaScript in browser (try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Local state persisting from previous sessions

Try clearing browser cache or testing in incognito mode to see the fixes in action! ðŸŽ®
